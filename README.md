### Recommendations:

Based on the comprehensive analysis findings, here are some recommendations to address the disparities and improve outcomes related to income and bike purchases:

### 1 Gender Income Disparities:

- Addressing Income Inequality: The average income for males ($58,000) is higher than for females ($54,331). Measures should be implemented to ensure fair pay across genders. Conduct salary audits to identify and rectify any gender pay gaps. Promote transparent pay practices and ensure equal opportunities for raises and promotions.

 
- Targeted Support for Female Employees: Since the income disparity is most pronounced among bike purchasers, considering targeted support for female employees, such as mentorship programs, career development opportunities, and leadership training, would help bridge the income gap.

### 2 Promote Bike Purchases:

- Encouraging Professional Engagement: Professionals account for 27.29% of bike purchases, it is important to leverage this group to promote biking within the organization. Highlight the benefits of biking, such as health, environmental impact, and cost savings.


- Addressing Income Disparity in Bike Purchases: With the average income for males who purchased bikes being $4,335.68 higher than for females, creating initiatives to encourage more females to purchase bikes will see thier numbers increase. This could include offering subsidies, discounts, or financing options for bike purchases specifically targeted at female employees.

### Educational Attainment and Income:

- Focus on Education: Graduate degrees correlate with the highest average income ($65,942), while partial high school correlates with the lowest ($34,102). Encouragement and support to employees in pursuing higher education and professional development. Offering tuition reimbursement programs, scholarships, or partnerships with educational institutions.

  
- Promoting Educational Opportunities: Across all educational levels, the average income ranges significantly. Ensuring that all employees have access to information about educational and training opportunities that could help them advance in their careers and potentially increase their income is very vital.

### Children and Bike Purchases:

- Promoting Family-Friendly Initiatives: Since 51.75% of children did not purchase bikes, family-friendly initiatives to encourage biking should be implemented. Organize family bike events, provide safety training, and create incentives for families to purchase bikes together.

  
- Understand Barriers: An investigation should be carried out why a higher percentage of children do not purchase bikes. This could involve conducting surveys to understand barriers such as cost, safety concerns, or lack of interest. Addressing these barriers through targeted programs and initiatives.


### Overall Recommendations:

- Conducting Detailed Surveys: Gathering of more data through surveys to understand the specific reasons behind income disparities and the factors influencing bike purchases. This data can be used to tailor strategies more effectively.

  
- Implementing Retention and Engagement Programs: Designing programs to improve overall employee satisfaction, engagement, and retention. This should includes offering competitive compensation packages, career advancement opportunities, and work-life balance initiatives.


- Monitor and Evaluate: Continuously monitor the effectiveness of implemented strategies and make adjustments as needed. Regularly evaluate income disparities, employee engagement levels, and the success of initiatives aimed at promoting bike purchases.
